# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "pdp0: 4-bit CPU in the style of PDP-1/TX-0"      # Project title
  description:  "The tiny 4-bit CPU packs a 3b program counter, an accumulator, and 8 6b words."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The two top bits in each word form the opcode (load, store, add, branch-if-zero) while the remaining four are the immediate field that the opcode uses.  Load and store only access the immediate field of the word.  The IO implements a simple command protocol to reset, load data, load code, and run.  The output are used for the PC and the Accumulator.  The test bench shows how to load a fibonacci computing program."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Use the command protocol to load programs and run them (see test bench)"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Besides interactining with the IOs, nothing is needed"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
